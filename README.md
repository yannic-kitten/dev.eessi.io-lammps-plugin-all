# `dev.eessi.io-lammps-plugin-all`

# `dev.eessi.io`

This is an example repository for the setup of the build and ingestion process for EESSI's `dev.eessi.io` CernVM-FS repository. This project is currently primarily intended for the [MultiXscale CoE](https://multixscale.eu) partners working on the development of the project's core applications.

`dev.eessi.io` project repositories are hosted on GitHub and follow the naming convention: `dev.eessi.io-projectname`. Once built and ingested, installations for each project will be available in systems that have EESSI available under `/cvmfs/dev.eessi.io/2023.06/projectname/`, where `2023.06` corresponds to the matching version of EESSI's `software.eessi.io` repository and [compatibility layer](https://github.com/EESSI/filesystem-layer).

## Installation instructions for new project repositories

This section details the steps needed to setup the infrastructure for a new project's repository and bot.

Setting up an instance of the bot for a dev.eessi.io project mostly consists of following the instructions detailed at the bot's [development repository](https://github.com/EESSI/eessi-bot-software-layer). There are however a few details and differences:

### app.cfg
The bot's `app.cfg` file needs to be adjusted to the cluster it is running on. Besides the obvious (app ID that points to the correct GitHub App, private key specific to this bot, etc,), these are:
``` ini
[buildenv]
build_job_script = bot/bot-build-dev.eessi.io.slurm@git@github.com:EESSI/dev.eessi.io-scripts.git
```
(This also requires an additional key pair, see details later!)

``` ini
[deploycfg]
...
bucket_name = { "dev.eessi.io": "dev.eessi.io-2024.09" }
```
If you are deploying the tarballs to an AWS S3 bucket, keep in mind you will need to install the necessary tooling and set it up following the instructions in the bot's [documentation](https://github.com/EESSI/eessi-bot-software-layer?tab=readme-ov-file#step-41-installing-tools-to-access-s3-bucket). You will also need the associated key pair for the bucket in question.


For the currently available architectures in the dev.eessi.io cluster:
``` ini
[repo_targets]
# defines for which repository a arch_target should be build for
repo_target_map = {
    "linux/x86_64/amd/zen2" : ["dev.eessi.io"],
    "linux/x86_64/amd/zen4" : ["dev.eessi.io"],
    "linux/aarch64/neoverse_n1" : ["dev.eessi.io"] }
```

### repos.cfg
The `repos.cfg` file needs to be configured for `dev.eessi.io`. All that needs to be changed is a section named `[dev.eessi.io]` with `repo_name=dev.eessi.io`. All other settings can remain the same as the production bot. You can find more detailed information about `repos.cfg` in the relevant section of the bot's [documentation](https://github.com/EESSI/eessi-bot-software-layer/blob/develop/README.md#repo_targets-section).

### Build script key pair
The `dev.eessi.io` bot uses a different script to start build jobs. This script is at https://github.com/EESSI/dev.eessi.io-scripts and is obtained through git from that repository (the repository and the script can be changed via the `[buildenv]` section in `app.cfg`). To do so, a key pair with at least read access is required in the GitHub account that owns the bot instance (most likely this will be https://github.com/EESSIbot). If setting up a new instance, a new pubkey should be [given to that GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) (currently can be done by @boegel and @bedroge), while the corresponding private key should be in `$HOME/.ssh` of the `bot` account in the build cluster.
